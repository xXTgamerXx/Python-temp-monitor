- This is my first project in python.
- Linux executables are available under https://github.com/xXTgamerXx/Python-temp-monitor/releases.
- The color of the text varies accordingly from Green, Yellow, Red.
- Update interval is 1 second, can be changed by editing the source code.
- This unfortunately wont work on windows as it uses psutil sensors - https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#sensors
- Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49550355/how-to-stop-a-program-when-a-key-is-pressed-in-python for the stopping command.
