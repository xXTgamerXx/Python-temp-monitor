- This is my first project in python.
- Linux executables are available under https://github.com/xXTgamerXx/Python-temp-monitor/releases.
- The color of the text varies accordingly from Green, Yellow, Red.
- Update interval is 1 second, can be changed by editing the source code.
- This unfortunately wont work on windows as it uses psutil sensors - https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#sensors
